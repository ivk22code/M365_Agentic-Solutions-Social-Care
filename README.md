# Adult Social Care — Crisis Prevention Solution

An AI-powered crisis prevention tool for adult social care caseworkers, built entirely on Microsoft Power Platform with no code.

## What it does

Caseworkers submit case assessments either through a Power Apps form or by chatting with an AI agent in Microsoft Teams. The system automatically analyses the case, suggests a RED / AMBER / GREEN risk rating, asks the caseworker to confirm or override the suggestion, then alerts the duty manager and guides the caseworker through next steps — all within seconds of submission.

## Key design principle — AI suggests, caseworker decides

This solution follows Model 1 of human-AI collaboration. The AI never makes the final risk decision — it suggests a rating based on the case evidence, and the caseworker confirms or overrides it. Both the AI suggestion and the caseworker's final rating are stored separately in Dataverse, providing a full audit trail of any overrides.

This approach is aligned with the Care Act 2014 principle that assessments must be led by a qualified professional.
